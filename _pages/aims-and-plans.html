<h3>Present Aims</h3>

<p>I created this website to share my dissertation research on King Philip’s War (1675-1678) in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. This northern region of New England is the homeland of the Wabanaki, or People of the Dawn. Published and last updated in December 2021, my website is the beginning of an independent Digital Humanities (DH) project and the second component of the DH Certificate program at Boston College.</p>

<p>This website has two primary (and sometimes conflicting) aims. First, it is intended to be an academic and educational resource on how Wabanaki peoples experienced King Philip’s War. A rich historiography exists on King Philip’s War in southern New England, where Metacom (alias King Philip) led the Wampanoag peoples and a loose Algonquin alliance of Nipmucks, Podunks, Nashaways, and Narragansetts (who were initially neutral but sided with Philip after the English attacked them in December 1675). However, few historians have devoted serious attention to the Wabanaki role in the conflict. The few existing studies of King Philip’s War in Wabanakia either treat it as an offshoot of the “real war” in Massachusetts and Rhode Island or the start of 80 years of near-constant frontier violence in the region.</p>

<p>Although the second interpretation has merit, it teleologically erases a crucial but overlooked part of the war’s outcome: although Metacom’s alliance was decisively defeated, the Wabanakis were victorious over the English and imposed their terms when peace was signed in April 1678. My JSS timeline on the welcome page is not intended as a complete history of King Philip’s War in Wabanakia. Rather, it highlights important moments in the conflict and shows how it ended in Wabanaki victory. In doing so, it aims to challenge conventional interpretations of the conflict as a watershed moment when Indians across the region succumbed to English control.</p>

<p>The second aim of this website is to present historical sources and dissertation research in a “raw” form. For each source on my JSS timeline, I have endeavored to provide necessary context and analysis while avoiding overinterpretation. This approach allows readers to directly engage with unfamiliar primary sources that are at the core of my research. I also hope to convey a sense of “doing” academic history and the uneven, process-driven nature of dissertation research.</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>

<p>I plan to expand and revise this website in the DH Capstone seminar in Spring 2022. I would like to add, remove, and edit the sources on my JSS timeline to better narrate King Philip’s War in Wabanakia. In particular, I hope that my revisions will better capture the negotiations that led to the peace in April 1678. I would also like to enhance the visualizations by interspersing maps, portraits, and other images on my timeline. I hope to make these revisions by continuing to work with Senior Liaison Librarian Bee Lehman, Digital Scholarship Librarian Matthew Naglak, and the rest of the team at BC Libraries.</p>
